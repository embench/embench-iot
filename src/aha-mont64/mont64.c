/* C program implementing the extended binary GCD algorithm. C.f.
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahcjm/combopt/ext_gcd_python_programs.pdf. This
is a modification of that routine in that we find s and t s.t.
    gcd(a, b) = s*a - t*b,
rather than the same expression except with a + sign.
   This routine has been greatly simplified to take advantage of the
facts that in the MM use, argument a is a power of 2, and b is odd. Thus
there are no common powers of 2 to eliminate in the beginning. The
parent routine has two loops. The first drives down argument a until it
is 1, modifying u and v in the process. The second loop modifies s and
t, but because a = 1 on entry to the second loop, it can be easily seen
that the second loop doesn't alter u or v. Hence the result we want is u
and v from the end of the first loop, and we can delete the second loop.
   The intermediate and final results are always > 0, so there is no
trouble with negative quantities. Must have a either 0 or a power of 2
<= 2**63. A value of 0 for a is treated as 2**64. b can be any 64-bit
value.
   Parameter a is half what it "should" be. In other words, this function
does not find u and v st. u*a - v*b = 1, but rather u*(2a) - v*b = 1. */
