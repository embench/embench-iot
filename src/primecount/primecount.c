   Program to count primes. I wanted something that could run in 16 KB but took enough
   time to measure on a modern x86 and is not susceptible to optimizer tricks.
   Code size is for just the countPrimes() function with gcc -O.

   Original x86&ARM data 2016, received user contributions 2019&2020 from eevblog members.

   WARNING: These results have not been calculated with the Embench infrastructure.
   The value of the parameter SZ and the methodolgy to calculate size and execution
   time are different in Embench, therefore these numbers aren't suitable for a direct
   comparison with the Embench results for the same architectures.

   SZ = 1000 -> 3713160 primes, all primes up to 7919^2 = 62710561
