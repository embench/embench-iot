# Embench&#x2122;: Open Benchmarks for Embedded Platforms

This repository contains the Embench&#x2122; free and open source benchmark
suite.  These benchmarks are designed to test the performance of deeply
embedded systems.  As such they assume the presence of no OS, minimal C
library support and in particular no output stream.

The rationale behind this benchmark is described in "Embenchâ„¢: An Evolving
Benchmark Suite for Embedded IoT Computers from an Academic-Industrial
Cooperative: Towards the Long Overdue and Deserved Demise of Dhrystone" by David
Patterson, Jeremy Bennett, Palmer Dabbelt, Cesare Garlati, G. S. Madhusudan
and Trevor Mudge (see https://tmt.knect365.com/risc-v-workshop-zurich/agenda/2#software_embench-tm-a-free-benchmark-suite-for-embedded-computing-from-an-academic-industry-cooperative-towards-the-long-overdue-and-deserved-demise-of-dhrystone).

The benchmarks are largely derived from the Bristol/Embecosm Embedded
Benchmark Suite (BEEBS, see https://beebs.mageec.org/), which in turn draws
its material from various earlier projects.  A full description and user
manual is in the [`doc` directory](./doc/README.md).

## Stable benchmark versions

The following git tags may be used to select the version of the repository for
a stable release.

- `embench-0.5`
- `embench-1.0`

## Using the benchmarks

The benchmarks can be used to yield a single consistent score for the
performance of a platform and its compiler tool chain.  The mechanism for this
is described in the [user manual](./doc/README.md).

- The benchmarks should all compile to fit in 64kB of program space and use no
  more than 64kB of RAM
  - **Note.** An earlier version tried to limit RAM to 16kB, but this proved
    too restrictive.

- The measurement of execution performance is designed to use "hot" caches.
  Thus each benchmark executes its entire code several times, before starting
  a timing run.

- Execution runs are scaled to take approximately 4 second of CPU time. This
  is large enough to be accurately measured, yet means all 19 benchmarks,
  including cache warm up can be run in a few minutes.

- To facilitate execution on machines of different performance, the tests are
  scaled by the clock speed of the processor.

- The benchmarks are designed to be run on either real or simulated
  hardware. However for meaningful execution performance results any simulated
  hardware must be strictly cycle accurate.

## Structure of the repository

The top level directory contains Python scripts to build and execute the
benchmarks.  The following are the key top level directories.

- [`config`](./config): containing a directory for each
  architecture supported, and within that directory subdirectories for board
  and cpu descriptions.  Configuation data can be provided for individual CPUs
  and individual boards.
  - **Note.** The structure of the [`config`](./config) directory is proving
    overly complex, yet inflexible. It is likely it will be flattened in a
    future release of the scripts.

- [`doc`](./doc): The user manual for Embench.

- [`src`](./src): The source for the benchmarks, one directory
  per benchmark.

- [`support`](./support): The generic wrapper code for
  benchmarks, including substitutes for some library and emulation functions.

- [`pylib`](./pylib): Support code for the python scripts
