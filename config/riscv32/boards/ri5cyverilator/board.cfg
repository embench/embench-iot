# This is a python setting of parameters for the board.  The following
# parameters may be set (other keys are silently ignored).  Defaults are shown
# in brackets
# - cc ('cc')
# - ld (same value as for cc)
# - cflags ([])
# - ldflags ([])
# - cc_define_pattern ('-D{0}')
# - cc_incdir_pattern ('-I{0}')
# - cc_input_pattern ('{0}')
# - cc_output_pattern ('-o {0}')
# - ld_input_pattern ('{0}')
# - ld_output_pattern ('-o {0}')
# - user_libs ([])
# - dummy_libs ([])
# - cpu_mhz (1)
# - warmup_heat (1)

# The "flags" and "libs" parameters (cflags, ldflags, user_libs, dummy_libs)
# should be lists of arguments to be passed to the compile or link line as
# appropriate.  Patterns are Python format patterns used to create arguments.
# Thus for GCC or Clang/LLVM defined constants can be passed using the prefix
# '-D', and the pattern '-D{0}' would be appropriate (which happens to be the
# default).

# "user_libs" may be absolute file names or arguments to the linker. In the
# latter case corresponding arguments in ldflags may be needed.  For example
# with GCC or Clang/LLVM is "-l" flags are used in "user_libs", the "-L" flags
# may be needed in "ldflags".

# Dummy libs have their source in the "support" subdirectory. Thus if 'crt0'
# is specified, there should be a source file 'dummy-crt0.c' in the support
# directory.

# There is no need to set an unused parameter, and this file may be empty to
# set no flags.

# Parameter values which are duplicated in architecture, board, chip or
# command line are used in the following order of priority
# - default value
# - architecture specific value
# - chip specific value
# - board specific value
# - command line value

# For flags, this priority is applied to individual flags, not the complete
# list of flags.

cpu_mhz = 1
